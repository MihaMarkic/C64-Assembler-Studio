# C64 Assembler Studio
C64 Assembler Studio is a cross-platform .NET based project aiming to create a comprehesive IDE including debugging experience for C64 assembler languages and [VICE emulator](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/) for debugging and running assembled programs. [Kick Assembler](https://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/) is first assembler supported. Others could follow. 

[Avalonia UI](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/) is used for GUI. For communication with VICE it is using my other project [VICE Binary Monitor Bridge for .NET](https://github.com/MihaMarkic/vice-bridge-net). A lot of code is same as in my  read-only debugging studio [Modern VICE PDB monitor](https://github.com/MihaMarkic/modern-vice-pdb-monitor).

## Status
Project is in early stages.
